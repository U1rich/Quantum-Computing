### Aprender los fundamentos de la computaci칩n cu치ntica. Entender la notaci칩n de Dirac y construye circuitos cu치nticos.

In this article , we explore the differences between qubits and classical bits. We see how to describe quantum state using Dirac notation. We observe the qubits can be placed in superposition, and see how calculate the probability of observable states. We also see how entangled qubits can determine each other's state. Finally we take a ride around te clock sphere, and see how a qubit's state can be visualized in 3 dimensions.
